List of files of qN source code and a brief description of what they contain

Basic Simulation ................... Checks basic trait and life cycle parameters to make qN runnable, compiles used and unused traits/LCE
                                     (defaults) to begin building the simulation
                                     
Simulation Components .............. Manages components of simulations and trait and life cycle input and sets of parameters (not a 
                                     runnable simulation)
