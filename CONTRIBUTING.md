Hey, thank you for contributing!

The following is a set of guidelines for customizing quantiNEMO and its packages, which are hosted on GitHub. These are mostly 
guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request. This project and 
everyone participating in it is governed by the Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report 
unacceptable behavior to morganholder15@gmail.com. Please remember that we do not own the copyright or the source code for quantiNEMO
(see README), and therefore these changes are for Vision Lab at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and those with explicit
permission.

If you encounter a bug or issue that you would like addressed:
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.

- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started 
  qN, files/parameters altered.

- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use 
  in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
  
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

- If you're reporting that qN crashed, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will
  be available in Console.app under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports". Include the crash report in the issue 
  in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a gist and provide link to that gist.

-Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after tweaking complied code) or was this always a problem? Can this problem be reproduced
on an older version?


If you would like to recommend/ask for a change in one of the files:

- Create an issue on the repsitory an use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.

- Be descriptive as possible when communicating suggested steps and behaviors, what makes these features helpful?

- include snippets of code whever possible



Thank you for your contribution!
